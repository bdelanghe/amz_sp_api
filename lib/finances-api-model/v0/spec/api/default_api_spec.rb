  # unit tests for list_financial_event_groups
  # Returns financial event groups for a given date range. Orders from the last 48 hours might not be included in financial events.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 0.5 | 30 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The preceding table contains the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput can have higher rate and burst values than those shown here. For more information, refer to [Usage Plans and Rate Limits](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/usage-plans-and-rate-limits).
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :max_results_per_page The maximum number of results per page. If the response exceeds the maximum number of transactions or 10 MB, the response is &#x60;InvalidInput&#x60;.
  # @option opts [DateTime] :financial_event_group_started_before A date that selects financial event groups that opened before (but not at) a specified date and time, in [ISO 8601](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/iso-8601) format. The date-time must be after &#x60;FinancialEventGroupStartedAfter&#x60; and more than two minutes before the time of request. If &#x60;FinancialEventGroupStartedAfter&#x60; and &#x60;FinancialEventGroupStartedBefore&#x60; are more than 180 days apart, no financial event groups are returned.
  # @option opts [DateTime] :financial_event_group_started_after A date that selects financial event groups that opened after (or at) a specified date and time, in [ISO 8601](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/iso-8601) format. The date-time must be more than two minutes before you submit the request.
  # @option opts [String] :next_token The response includes &#x60;nextToken&#x60; when the number of results exceeds the specified &#x60;pageSize&#x60; value. To get the next page of results, call the operation with this token and include the same arguments as the call that produced the token. To get a complete list, call this operation until &#x60;nextToken&#x60; is null. Note that this operation can return empty pages.
