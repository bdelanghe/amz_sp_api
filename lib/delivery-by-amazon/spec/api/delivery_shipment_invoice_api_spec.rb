  # unit tests for get_invoice_status
  # Returns the invoice status for the order or shipment you specify. You must specify either an &#x60;orderId&#x60; or &#x60;shipmentId&#x60; as query parameter. If both parameters are supplied, &#x60;orderId&#x60; takes precedence over &#x60;shipmentId&#x60;.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 1.133 | 25 |  The &#x60;x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit&#x60; response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The table above indicates the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may see higher rate and burst values than those shown here. For more information, see [Usage Plans and Rate Limits in the Selling Partner API](doc:usage-plans-and-rate-limits-in-the-sp-api).
